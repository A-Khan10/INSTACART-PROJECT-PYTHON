# INSTACART_PROJECT_PYTHON
Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis, open-source data sets from Instacart and a customer data set created and included for the purpose of this project by CareerFoundry, uses Python to analyse data to answer business questions.
# OBJECTIVE
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task is to perform an initial data analysis and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
# TOOLS
Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scipy
Software: Jupyter Notebooks and Excel
# SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
Cleaning data: removed duplicates; found and resolved missing values; addressed mixed or incorrect data types.

Merging data: The final merge was exported as a pkl file.

Exploratory analysis: explored basic descriptive statistics (max/min, quartiles, mean, standard deviation) for each variable as well as using histograms, scatterplots, and bar and line charts to explore the distributions of data.

Derived new variables: grouped data by user, order, and department
Used aggregated data to create flags about user ordering habits (such as ‘new customer’, ‘loyal customer’, etc.).
Visualising data: Create histograms, line charts, and bar charts (vertical/horizontal, stacked, and 100% stacked).
# DELIVERABLES
Reporting results: an Excel file that explained the answers to questions from sales and marketing as well as documenting the data population flow, consistency checks, data wrangling, and column derivations.
Final Report: Include analysis findings, visualisation, and recommendations to Instacart stakeholders.
